This is my Senior Design project which consists of designing and creating a smart buckle for child safety seats. 
The project takes the form of a three unit system where we our smart buckle comminucates with a key fob and android applicatpion. 
The system measures, tracks and reports critical safety information and provide visual and audible notifications to the user.

This project was created by programming two microcontrollers (Arduino) and adding different electrical components to measure 
the required safety fearures which included: room temperature, distance from buckle, battery status and proper buckling. 

The "smart buckle" served as the principal microcontroller and a second one as a key fob to alert directly to a user.
